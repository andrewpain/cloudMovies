This app was created to keep track of movies that are backed up on cloud storage.

Here, there are 3 folders: 
'app install' - contains the installation file, which installs the app;
'exe app' - contains the executable file, without the need to install;
'videoApp' - contains all the source files, so you may edit/improve

Choose whichever you prefer.

Once you start the application, It's fairly easy to use, first you pust the password in, which is first set to"pass".
