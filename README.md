**************************WELCOME!*************************

This app was created to keep track of movies that are backed up on cloud storage.

Here, there are 3 folders: 
'app install' - contains the installation file, which installs the app;
'exe app' - contains the executable file, without the need to install;
'videoApp' - contains all the source files, so you may edit/improve

Choose whichever you prefer.

Once you start the application, It's fairly easy to use, first you pust the password in, which is first set to"pass". 
You may want to change it to something more difficult.

From there you will get:
